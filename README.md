Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Tracey or T-racey when I am racing! :bicyclist:

As I write this, I am both excited and apprehensive about beginning my coding journey with the School of Code (SoC) Bootcamp.

I am a complete novice apart from what I have picked up from completing the SoC application tasks. 
I've enjoyed Harvardâ€™s CS50 course and Scratch and have completed some small Html / CSS projects via Freecodecamp.
I'm about to use Freecodecamp to facilitate the daunting #100daysofcode challenge.

Iâ€™m really interested in sports tech and hope I have the opportunity to explore this further down the line.:smile: 

**This would be a dream come true!**:+1:
